I wanted to give you a quick update on what's happening with my open-source projects. You may have noticed that I haven't been very active on this particular repository lately. That's because I've been keeping myself busy with a bunch of other exciting open-source ventures.

One such project is [url=https://github.com/ful1e5/bibata]bibata[/url]. I am thrilled to introduce this project to youâ€”a user-friendly web application designed for personalizing Bibata cursors. This initiative allows you to effortlessly download personalized versions of Bibata with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for intricate commands and potential headaches.
