[b]Bibata: End of an Era (v2.x.x Marks the Final Major Version)[/b]
I wanted to give you a quick update on what's happening with my open-source projects. You may have noticed that I haven't been very active on this particular repository lately. That's because I've been keeping myself busy with a bunch of other exciting open-source ventures.

One of those projects is [url=https://github.com/ful1e5/bibata.live]bibata.live[/url]. I'm super enthusiastic about turning this project into a user-friendly web application, [b]without archiving this repo[/b]. The idea is to allow you to download customized versions of Bibata with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for complex commands and headaches. It's all about simplicity and convenience.

Now, here's where you come in! I'm currently facing a bit of a time crunch, and I'd love your support. By sponsoring this project with just [b]$1 or more[/b], you can help me speed up its development and make it a reality as soon as possible. Your contribution goes a long way in fueling the project's progress.

But that's not all! If you encounter any issues with any of my other projects, you can also reach out to me live on [twitch.tv/ful1e5](https://www.twitch.com/ful1e5). Your feedback and bug reports are incredibly valuable, and they help me improve my work.

To make this journey even more exciting, you can join me on the [url=https://www.github.com/sponsors/ful1e5]Github Sponsor[/url] program. Together, we can work towards achieving my sponsorship goal and keep these open-source projects thriving.

Your support means a lot to me, and it brings us one step closer to making 'bibata.live' and other projects even better. Let's make open-source magic happen! Thank you for being a part of this adventure.
